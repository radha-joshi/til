HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content in between. 

Example Code
<openingTag>content</closingTag>

STEP 1

  The first element you will learn about is the h1 element. The h1 element is a heading element and is used for the main heading of a webpage.

  Example Code
  <h1>This is a main heading</h1>

STEP 2

  The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.

  Example Code
  <h1>most important heading element</h1>
  <h2>second most important heading element</h2>
  <h3>third most important heading element</h3>
  <h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
  <h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
  <h6>least important heading element</h6>

STEP 3

  The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

STEP 4

  Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts and ends with <!--,--> and can contain any no of lines of text.
